## Install R and RStudio on a new machine

1.  Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/> if you are using macOS and <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> if you are using Windows. Download the installer program, then run it to install R.
2.  Go to <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/> and download the open source edition of RStudio Desktop.

## Updating R and RStudio (if already installed)

Open RStudio and type `sessionInfo()` in the console. The first line should be something like `R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10)`, which tells you which version of R you're running. If it is not the most recent (4.2.1 as of July 2022) then you will want to update. You can re-download R from scratch, but then you'll need to re-download your packages. Fortunately there are packages that will migrate your packages.

**On Windows:**

``` r
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
updateR()
```

1.  **On macOS:**

``` r
install.packages('devtools') #assuming it is not already installed
library(devtools)
install_github('andreacirilloac/updateR')
library(updateR)
updateR() #will be prompted to enter your password
```

## R Packages

You will need to install the packages required to render Quarto documents. The easiest way to do this is to let RStudio do that for you.

-   Open RStudio

-   Go to to File -\> New File -\> Quarto document.

-   If you get a pop up saying that you need to install some packages, click "Ok". RStudio will install the packages and then open a sample document.

-   Click on the "Render" button (the blue arrow) to test your installation. If everything went well, you should see a new HTML file.

Other packages we will use are **tidyverse** (includes several packages in the tidyverse ecosystem), **data.table**, and **readxl**. These are on CRAN so you can install (or update) them with the usual

``` r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "data.table", "readxl"))
```

## Git and GitHub

It is recommended that you use Git and Github to manage your course project. Details on how to do this are best described in Jenny Bryan's fantastic [Happy Git with R book](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html). The core steps are:

1.  Install git on your machine.

    The instructions depend on your Operating System. Follow the instructions at <https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html>.

2.  Create a GitHub account.

    Go to [github.com](github.com) and create your free account.

3.  Create a Github personal access token

4.  [Store it in your keychain](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/updating-credentials-from-the-macos-keychain) (Mac) or in [Windows Credential Manager](https://kwilson.io/blog/use-windows-credential-store-for-git-to-remember-your-login-for-tfs-bitbucket-and-such/)

## LaTeX (optional)

Quarto documents can be rendered into HTML, Word, or PDF files. The assignments you turn in will be Quarto-generated HTML documents (like the one you're currently reading). But if you want to be able to make PDFs, you'll need a working LaTeX installation. The easiest way to do this is to use the [tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) R package. You should be up and running with these two commands:

``` r
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
