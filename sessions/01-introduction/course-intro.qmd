## Opportunity cost

The value of the next-best thing I could have done with these inputs (often, money)

-   A dollar spent on PrEP for people who inject drugs cannot be spent on photon radiation for children with cancer

-   A dollar spent on health [**care**]{.underline} cannot be spent on health [**research**]{.underline}

-   A dollar spent in health [**sector**]{.underline} cannot be spent on education, infrastructure, defense, etc.

## Challenges in global health

## Challenges in global health

-   Childhood mortality
-   Epidemic or endemic infectious diseases
-   Increasing burden of chronic conditions
-   Challenges sustaining health infrastructure
-   Limited access to care
-   Limited funds for disease prevention and treatment

## Challenges in Canada

## Challenges in Canada

-   Aging boomers
    -   \~50% of health care expenses incurred in last year of life
-   Chronic health conditions
-   Insufficient capacity → long queues for services
    -   Joint replacements, colonoscopy, emergency rooms, etc.

## How do we decide what to do?

*Decision criteria*

## How do we decide what to do?

*Decision criteria*

-   Effectiveness
-   Equity or fairness
-   Cost
-   Efficiency

## Key questions for decision analysis

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?
-   How can services be delivered efficiently?
-   How should we spend research dollars?

## Key questions for decision analysis

**Health policy**

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?

**Healthcare operations**

-   How can services be delivered efficiently?

**Health research**

-   How should we spend research dollars?

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (e.g. cost, effect, efficiency, equity)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  Estimate outcomes under each alternative

5.  Perform sensitivity analysis

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret results/make decision

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (e.g. cost, effect, efficiency, equity)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  **Estimate outcomes under each alternative → Modeling**

5.  **Perform sensitivity analysis → Modeling**

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret results/make decision

## Decision-analytic model

-   Function mapping inputs (data, parameters) into estimated outcomes for two or more alternatives
-   Propagate uncertainty
    -   Uncertain inputs → uncertain outputs

![](figs/model-inputs-outputs.svg)

## Decision analysis can...

-   Estimate monetary and nonmonetary consequences of alternatives
-   Suport decisions about investment into/design of programs
-   Inform allocation of resources
-   Provide insights with incomplete data (requires assumptions)
-   Inform data collection/research

## Decision analysis can't...

-   Perfectly capture reality
-   Account for unknown factors
-   Replace a decision maker

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   **Course overview**
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   Perspective and audiences

## Learning objectives

After EPIB 676, students will be able to:

-   Develop decision analytic models to inform health policy and clinical decisions
-   Understand and critically appraise model-based decision analyses
-   Create transparent reports of model-based decision analyses that conform to open science principles

## Decision analytic modeling and economic evaluation

Many economic evaluations use decision analytic models

-   **Exception**: prospective/data-driven (trial-based) economic evaluation

Many decision-analytic models used for economic evaluation

-   **Exception**: decision models without cost as output

## EPIB 676 vs PPHS 528

-   **EPIB 676:** decision analytic modeling (deeper)

    -   \~20% economic evaluation
    -   PhD level, research-oriented
    -   Prereqs: Stats, probability, math, intermediate programming

-   **PPHS 528:** economic evaluation (broader)

    -   \~20% decision analytic modeling
    -   MSc level
    -   Prereqs: Basic programing & stats

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   **Using R for decision analysis**
-   Perspective and audiences

## Software for decision-analytic modeling

-   Software programs
    -   TreeAge <https://www.treeage.com/>

    -   Excel

    -   Arena, Simio, Simul8
-   Programming languages
    -   Python, Julia, Matlab, C++, etc.

    -   R

## Why I like R

-   Free and open source, designed for data science
-   Code-based (easier to interrogate + version control)
-   Ecosystem of packages, tutorials, vignettes (less mature for others languages)
-   Friendly community of useRs
-   Systems for creating reproducible research reports
    -   Quarto documents!

## Resources for decision-analytic modeling in R

-   Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH)
    -   [Website](https://darthworkgroup.com/), [Github](https://github.com/DARTH-git)
-   R for Health Technology Assessment
    -   [Website](https://r-hta.org/)
-   Nathan Green's [List of Health Economics R Packages](https://github.com/n8thangreen/health_economics_R_packages)
-   'rcea' package and tutorial [website](https://hesim-dev.github.io/rcea/)

## Downsides of R

-   Learning curve for non-programmers (vs. Excel, TreeAge)
-   Base R not the fastest language
    -   Julia, C++, Matlab faster. **But,** can use [RCPP package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) to write compute-intensive operations in C++
-   Dependencies and back/forward compatibility
    -   Packages can have errors, may not be maintained
    -   Functionality can change after updates
    -   We will discuss some strategies to address

## R projects and Quarto

We will:

-   Create a new R project with quarto document
-   Clone the class repository from Github onto your computer
-   Edit and render assignment 0

## Completing programming assignments

Can

-   'Pull' most recent epid-676 repo from github

-   [**Rename**]{.underline} assignment .qmd file (e.g. add your initials) before editing to avoid merge conflicts

Or

-   Download zip file from github and work outside of an R project

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   **Perspective and audiences**

## Who is the audience of a decision analysis?

## Who is the audience?

-   Public health
-   Regulators
-   Clinicians / Medical societies
-   Patients & parent/guardian/loved one
-   Insurance companies
-   Researchers
-   Organizational leaders (of hospital, blood collector, etc.)
-   Funding agencies (e.g., CIHR)
-   ...

Depends on context; often **multiple**

## Perspective motivated by audience

-   Payers mostly care about their costs

-   Government may also care about [**societal**]{.underline} costs & benefits

    -   Patient time/transportation

    -   Productivity loss from illness or death

    -   Informal care-giving

    -   Spillover into criminal justice, education, etc.

-   Other stakeholders have other priorities (if possible, [**ask**]{.underline})

## The case for societal perspective

[First Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (1996)](https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1996.03540140060028):

> Using CEA to inform allocation of health resources accepts the existence of a limit on health spending; when the **societal perspective** is adopted, the analysis acknowledges the value of competing uses for society's resources

**But**, data on non-health benefits/costs are often lacking

## Why choose just one?

-   An analysis can have \>1 perspective
-   Societal [**and**]{.underline} healthcare payer perspective recommended by [Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/book/12265/chapter-abstract/161760944?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
-   Reporting disaggregated outcomes (e.g., costs by category) allows reader to re-calculate according to their value.

## The impact inventory
