## Opportunity cost

*The value of the next-best thing I could have done with the resources*

-   A dollar spent on PrEP for people who inject drugs cannot be spent on photon radiation for children with cancer

-   A dollar spent on providing care cannot be spent on health research

-   A dollar spent in health sector cannot be spent on education, infrastructure, defense, etc.

## Challenges in global health

## Challenges in global health

-   High childhood mortality
-   Epidemics of infectious diseases
-   Increasing burden of chronic condition
-   Poor health infrastructure
-   Limited access to care
-   Limited funds for disease prevention and treatment

## Challenges in Canada

## Challenges in Canada

-   Aging boomers
    -   50% of health care expenses incurred in last year of life
-   Chronic health conditions
-   Insufficient capacity → long queues for services
    -   Joint replacements, colonoscopy, emergency rooms, etc.

## How do we decide what to pay for?

*Decision criteria*

## How do we decide what to pay for?

*Decision criteria*

-   Cost
-   Effectiveness
-   Efficiency
-   Fairness

## Key questions for decision analysis

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?
-   How can these services be delivered most efficiently?
-   Where should we invest our research dollars?

## Key questions for decision analysis

**Health policy**

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?

**Healthcare operations**

-   How can these services be delivered most efficiently?

**Health research**

-   Where should we invest our research dollars?

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (cost, effects, efficiency, fairness)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  Estimate outcomes under each alternative

5.  Perform sensitivity analysis

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret the results

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (cost, effects, efficiency, fairness)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  **Estimate outcomes under each alternative → Modeling**

5.  **Perform sensitivity analysis → Modeling**

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret the results

## Decision-analytic model

-   Function mapping inputs (data, parameters) into estimated outcomes for two or more alternatives
-   Propagate uncertainty
    -   Uncertain inputs → uncertain outputs

![](model-inputs-outputs.svg)

## Decision analysis can...

-   Estimate monetary and nonmonetary consequences of alternatives
-   Suport decisions about investment into/design of programs
-   Inform allocation of resources
-   Provide insights with incomplete data (requires assumptions)
-   Inform data collection/research

## Decision analysis can't...

-   Perfectly capture reality
-   Account for unknown factors
-   Replace a decision maker

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   **Course overview**
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   Perspective and audiences

## Learning objectives

-   Develop decision analytic models to inform health policy and clinical decisions
-   Understand and critically appraise published model-based decision analyses
-   Create transparent reports of decision analyses that conform to open science principles

## Decision analysis and economic evaluation

Economic evaluations often use decision analytic models

-   **Exception**: trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis

Economic evaluations represent a large share of decision analysis

-   **Exception**: decision models without costs

## EPIB 676 vs PPHS 528

-   **PPHS 528:** economic evaluation theory and application

    -   \~20% decision analytic modeling

-   **EPIB 676:** decision analytic modeling,

    -   \~20% economic evaluation

Some overlap, but PPHS 528 is less research oriented. Requires less background in programming, probability, and math

## Course materials

**MyCourses** (<https://mycourses2.mcgill.ca/>)

-   Access readings, submit assignments

**Public Github repo** (<https://github.com/altonrus/epib-676>)

-   Everything else
-   To read HTML documents hosted on Github
    -   Download then open in web browser **or**
    -   <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?>

## Two phases

**Methods phase**

-   Read tutorials, textbooks

-   Technical lectures

-   Programming assignments
:::

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   **Using R for decision analysis**
-   Perspective and audiences

## Software for decision-analytic modeling

-   Software programs
    -   TreeAge <https://www.treeage.com/>

    -   Arena, Simio, Simul8

    -   Excel
-   Programming languages
    -   Python, Julia, Matlab, C++, etc.

    -   R

## Why I like R

-   Free and open source, designed for data science
-   Code-based (easier to interrogate + version control)
-   Ecosystem of packages, tutorials, vignettes (less mature for others languages)
-   Friendly community of useRs
-   Systems for creating reproducible research reports
    -   Quarto documents!

## Packages for decision-analytic modeling in R

-   Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH)
    -   [Website](https://darthworkgroup.com/), [Github](https://github.com/DARTH-git)
-   R for Health Technology Assessment
    -   [Website](https://r-hta.org/)
-   Nathan Green's [List of Health Economics R Packages](https://github.com/n8thangreen/health_economics_R_packages)

## Downsides of R

-   Learning curve for non-programmers (vs. Excel, TreeAge)
-   Not the fastest language
    -   Julia, C++, Matlab faster. **But,** can use [RCPP package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) to change compute-intensive operations in C++
-   Dependencies and back/forward compatibility
    -   Packages can have errors, not be maintained
    -   Functionality changes after updates
    -   Will discuss some strategies to address

## Getting started with R

We will:

-   Create a new R project with quarto document
-   Clone the class repository from Github onto your computer
-   Edit and render assignment 0

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   **Perspective and audiences**

## Who is the audience?

## Who is the audience?

-   Public health
-   Regulators
-   Clinicians / Medical societies
-   Patients
-   Parent/guardian or loved one
-   Insurance companies
-   Organizational leaders (of hospital, blood collector, etc.)
-   Funding agencies (e.g., CIHR)
-   etc.

Depends on context; often multiple target audiences

## Perspective motivated by audience

-   Payers want to know their own costs

-   Government may also care about societal costs & benefits

    -   Patient time/transportation

    -   Productivity loss from illness or death

    -   Informal care-giving

    -   Spillover into criminal justice, education, etc.

-   Other stakeholders have other priorities (if possible, ask)

## The case for societal perspective

[First Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (1996)](https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1996.03540140060028):

> Using CEA to inform allocation of health resources accepts the existence of a limit on health spending; when the **societal perspective** is adopted, the analysis acknowledges the value of competing uses for society's resources

**But**, data on non-health benefits/costs are often lacking

## Why choose just one?

-   An analysis can have \>1 perspective
-   **Societal** perspective and **healthcare payer** perspective recommended by [Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/book/12265/chapter-abstract/161760944?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
-   Reporting disaggregated outcomes (e.g., costs by category) can allow reader to re-calculate according to their perspective.

## The impact inventory
