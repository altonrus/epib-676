## Why decision analysis?

-   Demand for health resources nearly infinite
-   Resources (budgets) are limited
-   Choices must be made!

**Models can**

-   Estimate alternatives' osts, benefits, uncertainty

-   Help shape policy

-   Enable life-giving institutions to do more with limited resources!

## Key questions for decision analysis

**Health policy**

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?

**Healthcare operations**

-   How can these services be delivered most efficiently?

**Health research**

-   Where should we invest our research dollars?

## Learning objectives

-   Develop decision analytic models to inform health policy and clinical decisions
-   Understand and critically appraise published model-based decision analyses
-   Create transparent reports of decision analyses that conform to open science principles
