## Today

-   **Well-framed, simple models**

-   Conceptualizing a model/analysis

-   Parameterizing a model

-   Discuss course project

## Decision analysis as science + art

-   **Science:** developing and coding modeling methods correctly

-   **Art:** decide on analytic framework, relevant trade-offs, model structure, outcomes captured, parameter values and ranges, reporting (interpretation and contextualization)

-   Models are simplifications of reality, but deciding what to simplify is hard!

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (cost, effects, efficiency, fairness)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  **Estimate outcomes under each alternative → Modeling**

5.  **Perform sensitivity analysis → Modeling**

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret the results

## Free condoms at school?

A high school is considering offering free condoms to students. Some parents are concerned this will encourage students to have more sex, thereby **increasing** the spread of sexually transmissible infections.

<br>

**Purported risk:**

Condom availability $\rightarrow$ more sex $\rightarrow$ more STIs

## Lets define parameters

-   $U$ number of unprotected exposures

-   $P$ number of protected exposures

-   $\alpha$ chance of infection from unprotected exposure

-   $\gamma$ relative STI risk for protected exposures (with condom)

-   $\Delta$ number of additional protected exposures per exposure 'converted' to protected by free condoms

Assumption: constant prevalence (risk) of STIs

## Calculations

Infections without free condoms

$$
\alpha(U  + P \gamma)
$$

Infections with free condoms:

$$
\alpha(U-1  + (P+1+ \Delta) \gamma)
$$

## For free condoms to increase STIs

Infections with free condoms \> infections without

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha(U-1  + (P+1+ \Delta) \gamma) &> \alpha(U  + P \gamma)\\
U-1  + (P+1+ \Delta) \gamma &> U  + P \gamma\\
P \gamma + \gamma + \Delta \gamma - 1 &> P \gamma\\
\gamma - 1 &> -\Delta \gamma\\
\Delta &\geq \frac{1 - \gamma}{\gamma}
\end{align}
$$

## Assessing for different STI risk reduction factors

```{r}
#| echo: true
t_twoway <- tibble(
  rr_STI_with_condom = seq(0.05, 0.25, by=0.05)
) |>
  mutate(delta_for_STI_inc = (1 - rr_STI_with_condom)/
           rr_STI_with_condom)
t_twoway
```

## Should Canada screen immigrants for HIV?

-   In 1989, US banned HIV+ immigrants

-   Canadian politicians advocating for a ban

Zowell et. al. (1990) [HIV antibody screening among immigrants: a cost-benefit analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1452105/). *CMAJ* 143(2): 101-107

## Framing

-   Fair policy would be consistent with other diseases for which immigrants could be screened

-   Compare with potential screening for coronary heart disease (CHD)

-   Calculate economic burden of each disease over 10 years

## Prevalence and screening results

-   161,929 immigrants to Canada in 1988

-   Estimated \# HIV-infected immigrants in 1988 = (# immigrants)×(Estimated % HIV+) = 484

-   Expected screening test results:

    -   438 true positive

    -   16 false positive

    -   46 false negative

## Secondary infections

How many other people would these immigrants infect?

-   Newborns:\
    51% of immigrants are women $\rightarrow$ 247 women infected $\rightarrow$ 6.3 births from infected women $\rightarrow$ 1.9 HIV+ babies

Adults (sexual contact):

-   Calculated separately for gay men, other men, women:

-   (# new partners)×(p(transmission)) = \# HIV+ adults

-   Estimated that 54 adult sexual partners would become HIV infected

## Costs

-   Screening costs

    -   \$ 3.2 m -- initial HIV screening

    -   \$ .1 m -- confirmatory tests

    -   **\$ 3.3 m -- Total screening costs**

-   HIV care costs:

    -   \$ 17.1 m -- care for HIV+ immigrants

    -   \$ 1.0 m -- care for HIV+ adult contacts

    -   \$ .4 m -- care for HIV+ newborns

    -   **\$ 18.5 m -- Total HIV care costs**

## Burden of Chronic Heart Disease in immigrants

-   1.6% of immigrants would have CHD

    -   2,558 primary events (MI, CHF, etc.)

    -   651 recurrent events

    -   984 surgical procedures (pacemaker, etc.)

-   Total CHD care cost: \$21.6 m

## Conclusions from study

-   Focusing on HIV infection is arbitrary (and discriminatory?)

-   Screening for any disease that is ubiquitous and costly could save money

-   Other considerations

    -   Health of other Canadians

    -   Individual responsibility

    -   Other infectious diseases of immigrants (e.g., hepatitis)

## HIV and immigration since 1990

-   2010: US lifted ban on HIV-infected immigrants

-   2015: Singapore changed laws to allow visits, but not immigration

-   Some countries still ban immigrants living with HIV (Russia, Iran, UAE)

## Simple models takeaway

<br>

Simple models that get to the heart of decision-makers' (or critics') concerns can be a powerful tool towards informing a decision.

## Today

-   Well-framed, simple models

-   **Conceptualizing a model/analysis**

-   Parameterizing a model

-   Discuss course project

## Designing a decision analysis

-   Objectives

-   Research question

-   Perspective(s)

-   Intervention(s)/comparators

-   Target population

-   Scope

-   Time horizon

-   Analysis plan

## Defining objectives

If the goal is to inform policy, analysis must

-   Consider the policy context and controversies

-   Take a perspective/perspectives relevant to the audience(s)

Health policy is a collaborative process with many stakeholders. One must identify the target audience and understand their concerns.

## What if vs. what is?

**What is? studies**

-   Inform choice between existing options for current context

-   Data on cost and effectiveness available or can be estimated

**What if? studies**

-   Inform choice between potential options for future contexts with incomplete information

    -   How cheap does drug need to be?

    -   How much potential benefit from developing improved technology?

## Choosing analytic framework

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Audience and objective should inform type of analysis

-   Multiple results can and should be reported i.e. -- a good CEA reports costs and consequences as well!

-   Preliminary results can also inform what additional analysis is needed

## Defining alternatives

-   Many variations often possible

    -   Example: Breast cancer surveillance: Self-exam? Clinical exam? Mammography? Combinations? Every year? Every 2 years? 4 years? Changed based on age?

-   All interventions that would be realistically considered should be included

-   In practice, a limited set of interventions are sometimes used for feasibility

-   "Do nothing" or "status quo" should always be included!

## Including all alternatives

![](include_all_alternatives.png)

## Define target population

-   Often defined by age, sex, geography, disease status, risk profile, etc.

-   Examples:

    -   40-year-old patient presenting for the first time with an adenomatous rectal polyp \>2 cm in diameter

    -   All blood transfusion recipients in the 50 United States

    -   People who inject drugs between the ages of 12 and 40

-   Often, results are reported for different segments of the target populations

## Time horizon

-   Long enough to capture the differential costs and effects

-   Patient lifetime is often needed when policies influence when patients die

-   Often, the intervention is 'active' for a short period, but longer time horizon used to sum costs and effects

    -   We estimated the costs and effects of transfusion-transmitted Zika over the l**ifetime of infected transfusion recipients** that resulted from **one year of screening** under each policy

## Today

-   Well-framed, simple models

-   Conceptualizing a model/analysis

-   **Parameterizing a model**

-   Discuss course project

## Parameters are critical

"Garbage in garbage out" applies to decision models

<br>

Should we not make a model if too much is unknown?

-   Decision must be made either way

-   Model with poor data can help elucidate trade-offs, (un)importance of knowledge gaps

-   Uncertainty analysis & foregrounding limitations is critical!

## Quantitative data sources

A single large, rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) collects all relevant cost and effectiveness (QALY) data on all relevant interventions to enable a CEA (Most convenient but rare) A single large, rigorous RCT or a well-done meta-analysis estimates effectiveness (not QALY) for relevant interventions, but costs & utility must be estimated from other sources. (More common) Many sources are used to inform the different parameter values under different interventions, with no head-to-head trial comparing all of the interventions (Most common)

## Quantitative data sources

Cohrane library Synthesize data from many studies on important questions Google Scholar Pubmed Most relevant English-language publications indexed in Pubmed and in Google Scholar Sometimes good to search both Tufts CEVR Cost Effectiveness Registry Most \$/QALY analyses indexed Can search for prior work on topic Can also search for ICERS and utilities from other studies

## Imperfect hierarchy of evidence

-   Well conducted systematic review

-   Single best study

-   Subjective estimate

## Mini meta-analysis for key parameters

![](meta_analysis.png)

[Hewitson et. al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001216.pub2)

## Mini meta-analysis for key parameters

![](pooling_studies.png)

[Russell et. al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16704)

## Sourcing parameters from modeling studies

-   A recent model of same health condition in same population is a great source

-   Can even borrow some of their model structure

-   **BUT**, should always find root source of parameter values

    -   Can site both the modeling study and underlying data source

## Expert opinion

-   Informal methods (e.g., ask clinical collaborator) common

-   Should clarify difference between first order and second order uncertainty

    -   Largest plausible average cost \<\< largest plausible patient cost

-   Formal elicitation sometimes warranted

    -   Semi-Delphi processes popular

    -   "Use (and abuse) of expert elicitation in support of decision making for public policy", [Morgan (2013) *PNAS*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1319946111)

## Collaborators can help you

For students doing applied decision analysis, should have (at least)

-   One mentor/collaborator with experience doing cost-effectiveness

-   One mentor/collaborator with domain area expertise

## An iterative process

Develop analysis framework (states, time horizon, consequences, etc) Search for data to instantiate model framework Change model structure because data are formatted differently Add a new policy you did not initially know about Remove an intervention that is no longer recommended .....

Start simple and focus on what's important! A model should not perfectly mirror reality, but rather capture most important trade-offs of the decision
