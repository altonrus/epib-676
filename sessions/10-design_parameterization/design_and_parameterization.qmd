## Today

-   **Well-framed, simple models**

-   Conceptualizing a model/analysis

-   Parameterizing a model

-   Discuss course project

## Decision analysis is science + art

-   **Science:** developing and coding modeling methods correctly

-   **Art:** selecting framework, structure, alternatives, outcomes to model, parameter values/ranges/distributions, reporting (interpretation and contextualization)...

-   Models are simplifications of reality, but deciding what to simplify is hard!

-   Perfect models don't get finished

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (cost, effects, efficiency, fairness)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  **Estimate outcomes under each alternative → Modeling**

5.  **Perform sensitivity analysis → Modeling**

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret the results

## Capturing what matters

-   A 'standard' cost-utility analysis (cost per QALY) is often warranted

-   But creatively tailoring how an analysis is framed to the decision context can yield valuable insights

-   Simple models sometimes more effective than complex models

## Free condoms at school?

A high school is considering offering free condoms to students. Some are concerned this will encourage students to have more sex, thereby **increasing** the spread of sexually transmissible infections.

<br>

**Critic's concern:**

Condom availability $\rightarrow$ more sex $\rightarrow$ more STIs

(even if per-encounter risk is reduced)

## Let's define parameters

-   $U$ number of unprotected exposures

-   $P$ number of protected exposures

-   $\alpha$ chance of infection from unprotected exposure

-   $\gamma$ relative STI risk for protected exposures

    -   with condom; hopefully closer to 0 than 1

-   $\Delta$ number of additional protected exposures per exposure 'converted' to protected by free condoms

Assumption: constant prevalence (risk) of STIs

## Calculations

Infections without free condoms

$$
\alpha(U  + P \gamma)
$$

Infections with free condoms:

$$
\alpha(U-1  + (P+1+ \Delta) \gamma)
$$

## For free condoms to increase STIs

Infections with free condoms \> infections without

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha(U-1  + (P+1+ \Delta) \gamma) &> \alpha(U  + P \gamma)\\
U-1  + (P+1+ \Delta) \gamma &> U  + P \gamma\\
P \gamma + \gamma + \Delta \gamma - 1 &> P \gamma\\
\gamma - 1 &> -\Delta \gamma\\
\Delta &\geq \frac{1 - \gamma}{\gamma}
\end{align}
$$

## Assessing for different STI risk reduction factors

```{r}
#| echo: true
t_twoway <- tibble(
  rr_STI_with_condom = seq(0.02, 0.22, by=0.04)
) |>
  mutate(delta_for_STI_inc = round((1 - rr_STI_with_condom)/
           rr_STI_with_condom, digits=1))
t_twoway
```

## Should Canada screen immigrants for HIV?

-   In 1980s, US banned HIV+ immigrants

-   Canadian politicians advocating for a ban

Zowell et. al. (1990) [HIV antibody screening among immigrants: a cost-benefit analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1452105/). *CMAJ* 143(2): 101-107

## Framing

-   Fair policy would be consistent with other diseases for which immigrants could be screened

-   Compare HIV burden to that of coronary heart disease (CHD)

-   Estimate 10-year economic burden of HIV vs. CHD among immigrants

## Prevalence and screening results

-   161,929 immigrants to Canada in 1988

-   Estimated \# HIV-infected immigrants in 1988 = (# immigrants)×(Estimated % HIV+) = 484

-   Expected screening test results:

    -   438 true positive

    -   16 false positive

    -   46 false negative

## Secondary infections

How many other people would these immigrants infect?

-   Newborns:\
    51% of immigrants are women $\rightarrow$ 247 women infected $\rightarrow$ 6.3 births from infected women $\rightarrow$ 1.9 HIV+ babies

Adults (sexual contact or blood transfusion):

-   Calculated separately for gay men, other men, women:

-   (# new partners)×(p(transmission)) = \# HIV+ adults

-   Estimated that 54 adult sexual partners would become HIV infected

## Costs: HIV

-   Screening costs

    -   \$ 3.2 m -- initial HIV screening

    -   \$ .1 m -- confirmatory tests

    -   **\$ 3.3 m -- Total screening costs**

-   HIV care costs:

    -   \$ 17.1 m -- care for HIV+ immigrants

    -   \$ 1.0 m -- care for HIV+ adult contacts

    -   \$ .4 m -- care for HIV+ newborns

    -   **\$ 18.5 m -- Total HIV care costs**

## Burden of Chronic Heart Disease in immigrants

-   1.6% of immigrants would have CHD

    -   2,558 primary events (MI, CHF, etc.)

    -   651 recurrent events

    -   984 surgical procedures (pacemaker, etc.)

-   **Total CHD care cost: \$21.6 m**

## Conclusions from study

-   Banning HIV+ immigrants is arbitrary (and discriminatory?)

-   Screening for any disease with sufficient prevalence + cost could save money

-   Other considerations

    -   Risk to other Canadians

    -   "Individual responsibility"

    -   Other infectious diseases of immigrants (e.g., hepatitis)

## HIV and immigration since 1990

-   2010: US lifted ban on HIV-infected immigrants

-   2015: Singapore changed laws to allow visits, but not immigration

-   A few countries still ban immigrants living with HIV

    -   Russia, Iran, UAE

## Today

-   Well-framed, simple models

-   **Conceptualizing a model/analysis**

-   Parameterizing a model

-   Discuss course project

## Designing a decision analysis

-   Objectives

-   Research question

-   Perspective(s)

-   Intervention(s)/comparators

-   Target population

-   Scope

-   Time horizon

-   Analysis plan

## Defining objectives

If the goal is to inform policy, analysis must

-   Consider the policy context and controversies

-   Use perspective(s) relevant to the audience(s)

Health policy is a collaborative process with many stakeholders. Need to identify the target audience and understand the evaluation criteria they care about.

## What is? vs. what if?

**What is? studies**

-   Inform choice between existing options for current context

-   Data on cost and effectiveness available or readily estimated

**What if? studies**

-   Inform choice between potential options for future contexts, often with incomplete information

    -   How cheap does drug need to be?

    -   How much potential benefit from developing improved technology?

## Choosing analytic framework

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Informed by audience, objective, what's (un)known

-   Multiple results can and should be reported i.e. -- a good CEA reports costs and consequences as well!

-   Preliminary results can also inform what additional analysis is needed

## Defining alternatives

-   Many variations often possible

    -   Example: Breast cancer surveillance: Self-exam? Clinical exam? Mammography? Combinations? Every year? Every 2 years? 4 years? Vary frequency or modality by age?

-   All interventions that would be realistically considered should be included

-   In practice, a limited set of interventions are sometimes used for feasibility

-   "Do nothing" or "status quo" should always be included!

## Including all alternatives

Willingness-to-pay = \$100,000

![](include_all_alternatives.png)

## Define target population

-   Often defined by age, sex, geography, disease status, risk profile, etc.

-   Examples:

    -   40-year-old patient presenting for the first time with an adenomatous rectal polyp \>2 cm in diameter

    -   All blood transfusion recipients in the 50 United States

    -   People who inject drugs between the ages of 12 and 40

-   May wish to report results for \>1 subgroup

## What's in scope?

-   Theoretical impact of alternatives nearly endless

    -   Chemo vs. drug: staff time, environmental impact of production, medical waste, replacing out-of-work patient, "domino" effect of replacing the replacement....

    -   Cannot model everything!

-   Model processes and outcomes that

    -   Make substantial contribution to ***incremental*** impact of alternatives

    -   Target audience cares about ("face validity")

## Time horizon

-   Long enough to capture the relevant differences in costs and effects

-   Patient lifetime often needed when policies influence when patients die

-   Often, the intervention is 'active' for a short period, but longer time horizon used to sum costs and effects

    -   "We estimated the costs and effects of transfusion-transmitted Zika over the **lifetime of infected transfusion recipients** that resulted from **one year of screening** under each policy"

## Today

-   Well-framed, simple models

-   Conceptualizing a model/analysis

-   **Parameterizing a model**

-   Discuss course project

## Parameters are critical

"Garbage in garbage out" applies to decision models

<br>

Should we make models without "enough" data?

-   Probably, in some cases

-   Decision must be made regardless

-   Model with poor data can help elucidate trade-offs, (un)importance of knowledge gaps (guide research/data collection)

-   Uncertainty analysis & foregrounding limitations is critical!

## Quantitative data sources

-   A single large, rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) collects all relevant cost and effectiveness (QALY) data on all relevant interventions to enable a CEA **(Rare)**

-   A single large, rigorous RCT or a well-done meta-analysis estimates effectiveness for relevant interventions, but costs & utility must be estimated from other sources. **(More common)**

-   No head-to-head trial comparing all alternatives; many sources that inform different parameter values under different alternatives **(Most common)**

## Quantitative data sources

-   **Cohrane reports** synthesize data from many studies on policy relevant topics

-   **Google Scholar and Pubmed**

    -   Most relevant English-language publications in both

    -   Good to search both

-   **Tufts CEVR Cost Effectiveness Registry**

    -   Most \$/QALY analyses indexed

    -   Find prior CEAs

    -   Search for ICERS and utilities

## Imperfect hierarchy of evidence

"Traditional" hierarchy (best to worst):

-   Well conducted systematic review

-   Single best study

-   Subjective estimate

Murky in practice

-   How comparable are studies in systematic reviews?

-   How well do they map to your target population?

-   Sometimes, need to develop your own mini-systematic review

## Mini meta-analysis for key parameters

![](meta_analysis.png)

Screening for colorectal cancer with faecal occult blood test, [Hewitson et. al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001216.pub2)

## Mini meta-analysis for key parameters

![](pooling_studies.png)

Supplement of [Russell et. al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16704)

## Sourcing parameters from modeling studies

-   Recent model of same health condition in same population is a great source

-   Can borrow methods (with citation)

-   **BUT**, find and site original empirical paper

    -   Avoid propagating errors
    -   Can site modeling study and underlying data source

-   Also check for more recent data

## Expert opinion

-   Informal methods (e.g., ask clinical collaborator) common

-   Clarify difference between first order and second order uncertainty

    -   Largest plausible ***average*** cost \<\< largest plausible ***patient*** cost

-   Formal elicitation sometimes warranted

    -   Semi-Delphi processes popular

    -   See "Use (and abuse) of expert elicitation in support of decision making for public policy," [Morgan (2013) *PNAS*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1319946111)

## Collaborators can help

Ideally, students doing applied decision analysis have

-   $\geq 1$ mentor/collaborator with experience in decision-analytic modeling

-   $\geq 1$ mentor/collaborator with domain area expertise

## Iterative process

::::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
-   Develop analysis framework (states, time horizon, consequences, etc)

-   Search for data to instantiate

-   Change model structure because data are formatted differently

-   Add a new policy you did not initially know about

-   Remove an intervention no longer recommended

-   ...
