## Today

-   **Equity in health technology assessment policies**

-   Methods for decision-analytic modelers

## Dimensions of concern for health equity?

## Dimensions of concern for health equity?

-   Health, wealth, race and ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, (dis)ability, disease severity, socioeconomic status, neighborhood...

-   Access and outcomes

-   Intersectionality

## What equity dimensions should factor into resource allocation?

## Health system perspective on equity

-   Portfolio of services may be viewed as unfair if it:

    -   has unequal benefit or outcomes

    -   Creates unequal access

    -   Worsens existing inequities in health outcomes

-   Fairness/equity criteria can conflict with efficiency **and each other!**

## The traditional CEA approach

-   Maximize population health benefit with fixed budget

-   No consideration for distribution of benefits across population

-   "A QALY is a QALY is a QALY"

-   Many decision-making bodies disagree

## Norway's 3 criteria for health technology assessment

-   **Health-benefit:** prioritize interventions with greater expected health benefit (and other relevant welfare benefits)

-   **Resource:** prioritize interventions that requires fewer resources

-   **Health loss:** prioritize interventions for populations with a greater expected lifetime health loss in the absence of intervention.

[Ottersen et. al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.01.012)

## Dutch Proportional shortfall

For a disease

$$
\text{Proportional shortfall}=\frac{\text{Disease-related QALY loss}}{\text{Expeted QALYs without disease}}
$$

For a treatment

$$
\text{Proportional shortfall}=1-\frac{\text{Expected QALYs without treatment}}{\text{Expected QALYs without disease}}
$$

## Challenges with these approaches

-   Usually used to decide whether to add drugs/technology to formulary, not individual patient decisions

-   Same intervention, once approved, used for patients with differing severity

-   Assigning patient population to severity group challenging

    -   [Severity-adjusted probability cost-effective](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00810-8) could help

-   Do we consider age?

    -   Individual patient age not considered; average patient age is implicit

## Public support for severity-adjusted thresholds mixed

And sensitive to how the question is phrased

![](figs/Reckers-Droog support proportional shortfall.png)

## In general

-   [**High support**]{.underline} for considering equity in health resource allocation

-   [**Some consensus**]{.underline} on dimensions of equity to priorities

-   [**Low consensus**]{.underline} on exact, quantitative decision criteria for trading off equity vs. efficiency (QALY maximization)

    -   Norway has done the most work on this

## Today

-   Equity in health technology assessment policies

-   **Methods for decision-analytic modelers**

## Incorporating equity

Four types:

1.  Equity evidence review

2.  Equity constraint analysis

3.  Equity distribution analysis

4.  Equity trade-off analysis

Mirelman (2015) [Methods for incorporating health equity impacts in economic evaluation with applications to low and middle income countries](https://www.york.ac.uk/che/seminars/economic-evaluation/2015/andrew-mirelman/)

## Equity evidence review

-   What are the equity issues?

-   What is known about them?

-   What do stakeholders think?

**Pro:** does not require quantification of inequity

**Con:** less clear guidance for decision (& depends on available data)

## Equity constraint analysis

-   How much benefit is foregone if the most cost-effective option is ruled out on equity grounds?

**Pro:** flexible because 'equity grounds' not defined

**Con:** no explicit quantification of inequity. Only addresses 1/2 of equity-efficiency trade-off

## Equity distribution analysis

-   How much do subgroups gain and lose?

**Pro:** provides specific information on gains/losses by subgroup

**Con:** subgroup data may be unavailable; no explicit valuing of equity-efficiency tradeoff

## Equity trade-off analysis

-   Which intervention optimally balances efficiency and equity?

**Pro:** articulates and applies clear decision criterion

**Con:** complex calculation; defining "optimal" equity-equity trade-off is challenging

## Equity constraint analysis

![](figs/equity_efficiency_6.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example of equity constraints

![](figs/Cleary%20equity-efficiency%20HIV.png)

[Cleary et. al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1542)

## Cleary 2009 approach

-   HIV care can be "no-ART", "first-line ART only", or "first and second-line ART"

    -   Alternatively, can provide no treatment

-   Decision-model + constrained optimization

-   For fixed budgets, maximized QALYs under constraints:

    -   **Equal treatment**: everyone gets [**same**]{.underline} treatment

    -   **Decent minimum**: everyone gets [**some**]{.underline} treatment

    -   **Health maximization**: no constraint

## Equity distributional analysis

![](figs/equity_efficiency_7.png)

## Extended cost-effectiveness analysis

![](figs/ECEA_1.png)

[Stéphane Verguet, Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/stephane-verguet/extended-cost-effectiveness-analysis-ecea/)

## ECEA motivation

-   In many countries, access to healthcare differs by wealth

    -   Public system (partially) government funded, but limited offerings

    -   Private system paid for out of pocket

-   Decisions to cover services will have different financial impacts on more wealthy vs. less wealthy people

## Measures considered in ECEA

Estimate by subgroup (usually wealth-based)

-   **Health gains:** usually QALYs

-   **Private (patient) expenditures averted:** for health, direct non-medical costs, time, or productivity costs

-   **Financial risk protection:** will out-of-pocket costs lead to financial hardship?

    -   Depends on size of out-of-pocket-cost + income/wealth of patient

## Equity trade-off analysis

![](figs/equity_efficiency_8.png)

## DCEA: distributional cost-effectiveness

-   For health sector decisions with objective of reducing health inequities

-   Focuses on health benefits and opportunity costs assuming fixed health sector budget

-   Twin policy goals

    -   Improve overall health

    -   Reduce health inequities

Asaria et. al. 2016 [Distributional cost-effectiveness: A tutorial](doi.org/10.1177/0272989X15583266)

## DCEA: Two stages

1.  Model social distribution of health for each strategy

2.  Evaluate social distributions of health

## DCEA modeling stage

-   Estimate the baseline health distribution
-   Model changes due to interventions being compared, allowing for the distribution of opportunity costs from additional resource use
-   Adjust the resulting modeled health distributions for alternative social value judgments about fair and unfair sources of health variation.

## DCEA evaluation stage

-   Use the estimated distributions to quantify the change in total population health and [**unfair**]{.underline} health inequality due to each intervention

-   Rank the interventions based on dominance criteria;

-   Analyze trade-offs between improving population health and reducing unfair health inequality, allowing for alternative specifications of the social welfare function.

## Example application

-   NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Program: Every 2 years age 60 - 74, participants mail stool samples for fecal immunochemical testing.

-   Pilot data reveals variation in uptake by neighborhood social deprivation, sex, and ethnicity

-   Impact on morbidity and mortality estimated via modeling

## Decision problem

Should we promote participation?

1.  **No screening**

2.  **Status quo:** no reminder

3.  **Targeted reminder:** letter signed by GP + info packet to:

    -   Most income-deprived neighborhoods (40%)

    -   Neighborhoods with highest % from Indian subcontinent (20%)

4.  **Universal reminders:** GP-endorsed letter to all patients

## Baseline distribution of health

-   Measured in interpersonally-comparable ratio scale

-   Include full general population (resources used for strategy have opportunity cost for whole society)

-   Describe variation in health across multiple subgroups (correlation of dimensions)

    -   Dimensions with cost/benefit variation and or equtiy concerns

## Baseline distribution of health

In cancer screening example:

-   Measured quality-adjusted life expectancy at birth

-   Subgroups defined by

    -   Sex

    -   Neighborhood deprivation quintile

    -   Neighborhood ethnic diversity (% from Indian subcontinent)

## Baseline distribution of health

![](figs/DCEA_QALE_by_quintile.png)

## Distribution of health changes

-   Difference in costs and effects of intervention in subgroups

-   Parameters can vary by subgroup

    -   Disease prevalence, severity, mortality, natural history

    -   Intervention uptake

    -   Intervention direct costs

    -   Intervention health effects

    -   Opportunity costs from displaced activities

    -   Other cause mortality

## Distribution of health changes

-   Difference in costs and effects of intervention in subgroups

-   Parameters can vary by subgroup

    -   Disease prevalence, severity, mortality, natural history

    -   **Intervention uptake**

    -   Intervention direct costs

    -   **Intervention health effects**

    -   Health opportunity costs from displaced activities[^1]

    -   **Other cause mortality**

## Intervention uptake

::::: columns

**No screen:** None

**Status quo:** apply odds of participating from pilot study to status quo participation counts

## Intervention uptake

![](figs/DCEA_uptake_prob.png)

## Intervention health effects

-   Assume cancer incidence, costs, effects same in each subgroup

-   Compute quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) gains that factor in subgroup-specific other-cause mortality and quality-adjustments

-   Main differences come from differences in uptake

## Health opportunity costs

-   Sum all costs

-   Convert to 'Health opportunity cost' in quality adjusted life years

    -   Divide costs by £20,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold

-   Base case: All subgroups benefit equally from opportunity cost

-   Extreme scenarios: all opportunity costs go to

    -   Worst-off quintile

    -   Best-off quintile

## Net health gains by subgroup

**Example calculation:** women in areas with low % from Indian subcontinent in deprivation quintile Q3

-   Lifetime net present cost of intervention (all subgroups)

    -   £72 million

-   Health opportunity cost (all subgroups)

    -   £72 million/£20,000 per QALY = 3600 QALYs

-   \% population this subgroup: 10%

    -   Allocated health opportuntiy cost: 360 QALYs

-   Net health gains = QALY gains from program minus 360 QALYs

## QALE by subgroup by strategy

![](figs/DCEA_QALE_by_subgroup.png)

## Fairness-adjusted health distributions

-   Equity analysis should focus on variation in health deemed unfair by social value judgement

-   May view some unequal outcomes as "fair" and others as "inequities"

-   Can collapse subgroups together along dimension that isn't of equity concern before evaluating social distribution of health

## Identify dominated interventions

-   Interventions should only remain if they maximize benefit in at least one subgroup

-   Can also apply more complex dominance rules

-   In our example, "no screening" and "standard screening" are strictly dominated by "Universal screening"

## Analyze trade-offs using social welfare indices

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Can calculate *equally distributed equivalent* level of health

-   Difference between mean health in distribution and EDE represents amount of health we will sacrifice to achieve full equality

-   Can consider absolute inequality (Atkinson) or relative inequality (Kolm)

## Preferred intervention by welfare index

![](figs/DCEA_prefered_int_by_welfare_index.png)

For low inequality aversion levels, we prefer universal reminders. For higher inequality aversion, we prefer targeted reminders

## Sensitivity analysis: who 'pays' opportunity cost?

![](figs/DCEA_opp_cost_sens_analysis.png)

## Recap
