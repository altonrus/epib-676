-   Using stats/ML in decision analysis
    -   Multi-state modeling survival analysis
    -   Machine learning example

## Stats/ML vs. decision models

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Stats & ML**

-   Derive insights from data

-   Methods for understanding/estimating heterogeneity

-   Good at understanding "**what is**" from complete data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Decision-analytic models**

-   Integrate (data-informed) paramters

-   Traditionally for estimating 'average' policy impact

-   Good at extrapolating, asking "**what if**" using incomplete/unlinked data
:::

## Causal inference

Identifying causal relationship requires causal methods

-   Statistical methods for causal inference

-   Causal ML (note: most ML methods are not causal)

Typical decision models [**embed causal assumptions**]{.underline} and [**extrapolate**]{.underline} to quantify outcomes

-   Ideally, causal assumptions based on well-done causal inference studies (randomized trial or quasi-experimental study)

    -   Multi-state modeling survival analysis
    -   Machine learning example

## Trial-based economic evaluation

-   Increasingly, trials designed with cost-effectiveness component

-   Data collection plan for costs and QALY estimation

    -   Consent to access clinical/administrative data on health resource utilization

    -   Periodic survey to derive health-related quality of life weights & non-health outcomes (productivity, caregiver, time costs)

## Trial-based economic evaluation

Statistical methods for conducting CEA over time horizon of the trial

-   Missing data imputation

-   Regressing cost/QALYs for subgroup analysis

    -   seemingly unrelated regression to capture correlation

-   Bootstrapping for probabilistic sensitivity analysis

Extrapolating over patient lifetime requires modeling

## Tutorial for trial-based economic evaluation

Not main focus of this class, but here is a helpful tutorial

## Multi-state survival modeling

## Competing risks

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Cancer treatment trials often report 'progression-free' and 'overall' survival for limited time horizon

-   Model can extrapolate to lifetime horizon

-   Must account for competing risks

## Panel vs. survival data

**Survival data**

-   If event observed, we have exact time to event

-   Usually some individuals right censored (end of follow-up)

-   Ex. time to diagnosis, time to death

**Panel data**

-   Data collected at specific intervals

-   Observe if an event happened between last observation and this one

-   Ex. chlamydia infection between this screen and the last one

## Tutorial data source

-   Trial of first-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia

    -   RFC: rituximab + fludarabine + cyclophosphamide (403 patients)

    -   FC: fludarabine + cyclophosphamide (407 patients)

-   Trial horizon 4 years (many patients alive at trial end)

-   Model horizon 15 years (estimate \<2% cohort alive)

## Steps

![](figs/williams_process_overview.png)

## Markov or semi-Markov?

-   **Markov assumption:** future transitions depend only on the current state (not history)

-   If violated, can use state-arrival ***extended*** multi-state model to include covariates in transitions

## Cox proportional hazard model

-   Semi-parametric model of time until an event

-   Covariates (e.g., history, sex) can increase or decrease average time to events

-   Hazard ratios estimated for covariates (\>1 if covariate decreases time-to-event)

-   Proportional hazards means they can be multiplied to estimate mean time-to-event

## Assessing Markovian & proportional hazard assumptions

-   log-log plot

-   Cumulative hazard vs. time

-   Fit cox models

## Log-log plots

![](figs/williams%20loglog.png)

Lines fairly parallel, suggesting proportional hazards reasonable

## Cumulative hazards vs. time

![](figs/williams%20cumulative%20hazard.png)

\(a\) and (b) suggest increasing hazards may be appropriate. (c) suggests lack of treatment effect on progression -\> death transition

## Conclusions so far

-   No severe violation of proportional hazard assumption, so we should consider proportional hazard models

-   Next step:

    -   Build a Cox Markov state-arrival extended model for progression → death transition

## Cox Markov State-Arrival Extended Model on progression → death

| Covariate                   | HR (95% CI)           | P value |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Treatment                   | 1.555 (0.874, 2.7666) | 0.133   |
| Time spent progression free | 0.413 (0.215, 0.794)  | 0.008   |

-   Time progression-free impacts progression → death transition

-   Markov property doesn't hold; semi-Markov model needed.

## Steps

![](figs/williams_process_overview.png)

## Building semi-Markov models

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Estimate progression→death first (no competing risk)

-   Fit multiple time-to-event distributions

-   Include time spent progression-free as covariate

## Model for progression → death

-   Log-logistic minimized AIC (fit to KM curve the best), but all were similar

-   Other distributions 15-year extrapolation seemed more 'reasonable' (more compatible with expert opinion on how many patients are expected to survive 15 years post-progression). Therefore, Gompertz distribution selected.

## Selecting model for other transitions

## Steps

![](figs/williams_process_overview.png)

## Life years, costs, QALYs

Used data from the trial for mean cost/QALYs of progression-free & progressed under each intervention.
