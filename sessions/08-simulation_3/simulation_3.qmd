[*Discrete Event Simulation for Health Technology Assessment (2016) by Caro et. al.*](https://www.routledge.com/Discrete-Event-Simulation-for-Health-Technology-Assessment/Caro-Moller-Karnon-Stahl-Ishak/p/book/9780367737689)

## Discrete event simulation strengths

-   Model heterogeneous population\*

-   Time-varying parameters\*

\*same as microsim

-   Represent disease as continuous process

-   Model [**capacity-constrained**]{.underline} resources

-   Entity types interact (patient, provider, tumor, etc.)^+^

^+^In a limited way

## Key components

-   **Events:** instantaneous change to entity or system

-   **Entities:** person or thing that experiences events

    -   patients, providers, implant, ambulance, etc.

-   **Attributes:** information specific to entity

-   **Resources:** provide service and have fixed capacity

    -   Providers, exam room, operating room, ventillator, etc.

-   **Queues:** lists of entities waiting for resource

## DES in health vs. elsewhere

-   DES common for manufacturing, logistics, traffic engineering

-   Focus usually on **system-level outcomes**

    -   Production volume, wastage, resource utilization, processing time

-   Health applications focus more on state of **entities** (patients)

    -   Often, track more individual-level attributes

## Examples of events

![](des_event_examples.png)

## Event graph

![](DES-event-graph.png)

Arrows show sequence of events.

## Discrete events but continuous time

-   Events are instantaneous

-   Time between events usually sampled from distribution

-   State of system updated each time an event occurs

-   Unlike discrete time models with a constant cycle length, the "step size" varies depending on the time between events

    -   "Next-event-time-advance"

## Attributes

-   Some assigned at baseline and not changed (e.g., sex), others updated by events (e.g., cumulative costs, blood pressure)

-   Probability & timing of events can depend on attributes

## Example: time to competing events

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Events can have different distributions
time_to_checkup = rep(1, 15)
time_to_polyp = rexp(n=15, rate = 1.5)
# The clock goes until the next one occurs
time = pmin(time_to_checkup, time_to_polyp)
event=ifelse(time_to_checkup<time_to_polyp, "checkup","polyp developed")
cat(paste0("i: ", 1:15, "   event: ", event, "   time: ", time, "\n"))
```

## Global variables

-   Track the state of the system

-   Global variables memory-efficient compared to attributes

-   Some applications track only global variables

![](attribute-vs-global-variable.png)

## Global variable examples

![](global_variable_examples.png)

## Time

-   Pre-specify total simulation time, run until reach

-   Entities created and removed at various times

-   Capacity constrained resources are "seized" and "released" by entities

## Today

-   System dynamics

-   Choosing a model structure

[*Chhatwal & He (2015). Economic evaluations with agent-based modelling: An introduction.*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-015-0254-2)

## Why agent based models?

-   Can model autonomous agents interacting with each other and their environment

Combine benefits of:

-   Differential equations model

    -   direct modeling of disease transmission or information spread

-   Microsimulation/discrete event simulation

    -   flexible, individual-level, easier to instantiate heterogeneity

## Schematic

## Agents and environments

-   **Agents**: usually people, but could be animals, vehicles, companies, molecules, cells etc.

-   **Environment**: country, city, hospital, school, prison, twitter, airplane, body, organ, etc.

## Agents

-   Response to environment and other agents is programmed

    -   Can depend on characteristics and history (memory)
    -   Not centrally controlled

-   Allows estimation of "network effects"

    -   Benefit of intervention depends on others' behavior

    -   e.g., vaccination, sexually transmitted disease testing

## "Bottom up" system modeling

-   Behavior programmed at the individual level

-   System dynamics observed, not imposed

-   Individual behavior $\rightarrow$ system dynamics:

    -   Sex practices $\rightarrow$ HIV epidemic size

    -   quarantine adherence $\rightarrow$ Ebola control

    -   Vaccination + mixing while sick $\rightarrow$ flu season peak

## Network structure matters

-   Homogeneous mixing unrealistic

    -   Some have many connections ("high degree") others have few

    -   Some networks are dense, others are sparse

-   Create networks by:

    -   Empirically estimating or calibrating from data

    -   Algorithmically create via sampling rules

-   Network often [**dynamic**]{.underline} (connections dissolve and re-form)

## Discrete or continuous

-   Two options:

    -   Fixed cycle lengths (like cohort models)

    -   Continuous time discrete event approach (like discrete event model)

-   Fixed cycles usually easier to program

## The downside: compute

-   Often most computationally intensive models to program.

-   Microsimulation variance reduction techniques hard to apply

    -   e.g., common random numbers less useful when one interaction can change everyone's trajectory

-   Due to complexity, R may not be language of choice (Matlab, C++, Julia likely faster)

## Ex: PrEP for people who inject drugs[^1]

**Objective:** Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PrEP for PWID under different targeting strategies (Assume PrEP+Screen+ART and 25% coverage)

## System dynamics philosophy

Actions can have consequences through complex and non-linear feedback loops

![](SD-domino-guy.png)

## Stocks and flows

-   Stocks = compartment/state; Flows = transitions

-   Analogy: faucet, bathtub, drain

![](SD_disease_stock_flow.png)

## More stocks and flows

![](SD-stock-flows-more.png)

## Feedback loops

> A closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock -Meadows (2008)

What separate SD models from traditional differential equations models

2 types:

-   **Balancing:** negtaive feedback, "goal-seeking"

-   **Reinforcing:** positive feedback, "run-away"

## Heating a room: balancing loop (negative feedback)

![](SD_feedback_room_heat.png)

## Capital investment: reinforcing loop (positive feedback)

![](SD_feedback_capital_growth.png)

## Ex: Opioid misuse and use disorder

## Today

-   Discrete event simulation

-   Agent based model

-   System dynamics

-   **Choosing a model structure**

## Choosing model structure

-   Goal: capture relevant differences between strategies

-   "As complex as needed, as simple as possible."

![](model_categorization.png)

## Where we are

-   Have completed method lectures on model structures!

-   Remaining methods lectures focus on design, parameterization, workflow, uncertainty analysis

-   Will soon start 'applied' phase with lots of examples

## Recap

-   Discrete event simulation model [capacity constrained]{.underline} systems in continuous times

-   "Bottom up" agent based models assess how individual behavior impacts system outcomes

-   "Top down" system dynamic (cohort) models use feedback loops to assess system behavior

-   **Regardless of structure: start simple and add complexity!**
