## Today

-   **Decision analytic frameworks**

-   Quantifying health

-   Quantifying costs

-   Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)

## Purpose of decision analysis

Systematically integrate key elements of decision

-   **Alternatives:** What can I do?

-   **Information:** What do I know?

-   **Preferences:** What do I value?

-   **Uncertainty:** How sure can I be?

Provide insight to inform or guide decision making

## Choosing decision analytic framework

![](images/choosing_eval_type_table.png)

**Not shown:** Equity-informative frameworks (more later)

## What matters for making decisions?

***Differences*** in costs and outcomes (not total cost or outcome!)

Typically

-   Immediate cost, health impacts of the intervention(s)

-   "Downstream" costs, health impacts

    -   Long-term disability

    -   Chronic disease

    -   Recurring risks

## Time horizon

-   Should capture all relevant differences in costs & health outcomes

-   Short time horizon sometimes OK

    -   No substantial cost/outcome differences expected after short period

-   Patient lifetime horizon often needed

    -   Differences in mortality

    -   Differences in risk of chronic conditions

    -   Differences in risk of events over remaining lifespan

## Today

-   Decision analytic frameworks

-   **Quantifying health**

-   Quantifying costs

-   Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)

## Example health measures

## Example health measures

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Life years gained

HIV cases averted

Blood pressure reduction

Cholesterol reduction

Number of adverse events

Cases detected

Percent infected in treatment
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Episode-free days

Reduction in pain scale

Reduction in emergency room visits or readmissions

Survey-based score (e.g., overall health, anxiety)

...
:::
:::

## Choice of health measure

**Context-specific** measures work within narrow context

-   Blood pressure medication → mmHg blood pressure

-   Hepatitis B screening strategies → % cases detected, incidence

-   HIV antivirals → % with high CD4 level

**General measures** let you compare across contexts

-   Life years gained

-   Quality-adjusted life years gained

## Net present value

-   Benefits further into future valued less (why?)

-   Net present value ($NPV$) of quantity $Q$, $t$ years into the future, with a discount rate $r$:

$$
NPV = Q \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$


```{r}
#| echo: true
Q <- 100 #dollars
t <- 5 #years into the future
r <- .05 #5 percent annual discount rate
NPV <- Q*(1/(1+r)^t)
NPV
```


## Discounted life expectancy (DLE)

-   Life years gained today valued more than life years gained in future

$$
DLE = \sum_{t=0}^T LY_t \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$

$LY_t$ is life-years experienced in year t. $[1/(1+r)^t]$ is the discounting multiplier for an annual discount rate of $r$ (typically \~ 0% to 7%)

## Quality-adjusted life expectancy

-   Health-related utility weight $u_t$

    -   1 = in perfect health

    -   0 = dead

$$
QALE = \sum_{t=0}^T u_tLY_t \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$

## How to estimate health related utility weights?

Reflect societal or patient preference. Many elicitation methods

-   Standard gamble

-   Time trade off

-   Discrete choice experiments

-   Survey-based instruments (EQ-5D, SD6)

    -   Often used for trial-based decision analysis

But, modelers often use existing estimates

## Where to find utility weights?

-   Search the literature

-   [The Cost-Effectiveness Registry](https://cevr.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/databases/cea-registry) from Tufts Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health

-   [Global Burden of Disease Study](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2019-disability-weights) (for disability weights in DALY studies)

If no published estimate available:

-   Pick something similar as a proxy, but **do thorough sensitivity analysis!**

## Today

-   Decision analytic frameworks

-   Quantifying health

-   **Quantifying costs**

-   Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)

## Cost parameters

-   Lower bound of 0

-   Potentially no upper limit

-   Often vary considerably across patients

-   **Patient-level** costs often right-skewed (a few high-cost patients)

    -   But, parameter of interest usually **average cost**, should be less skewed

## Health resources and costs?

-   **Administrative data:** encounters (clinic, emergency room, hospital), procedures, length of stay. Follow patients across care settings

-   **Clinical data:** labs, drugs, blood units transfused. Usually for one care setting.

## Discounting costs

-   People/organizations want to get paid sooner, make payments later

-   Net present cost discounted just like outcomes: $NPC = \sum_{t=0}^T c_t \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$

-   [CADTH recommends 1.5% discount rate](https://www.cadth.ca/guidelines-economic-evaluation-health-technologies-canada-4th-edition) (sensitivity analysis at 3%)

-   Same discount rate used for costs & outcomes (contested in theory but near universal practice)

## Currency exchange

-   Suggested to use purchasing power parity (estimated cost of a basket of goods) rather than exchange rate

-   Available from OECD data: <https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm>

-   Measured as national currency per USD

-   For non-USD currency, convert to USD and then to CAD:

    -   \[Value in Euro\] / \[PPP Euro/USD\] = \[Value in USD\]

    -   \[Value in USD\] / \[PPP CAD/USD\] = \[Value in CAD\]

## Adjust for inflation

-   Suggested to use the annual average all-item consumer price index (CPI)

-   \[Year Y cost\] = \[Year X cost\] x \[Year Y CPI\] / \[Year X CPI\]

-   Available from StatsCanada: <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1810000501>

## Currency + inflation

Convert \$5,400 in 2006 USD to 2021 CAD?


```{r}
#| echo: true
cost_2006USD = 5400
PPP_2006 = NA;    CPI_CAN_2006 = NA

```


## Inflation + Currency adjustment

-   Order can matter, especially with fluctuations

-   I'm not aware of best practice recommendations

-   If difference is substantial

    -   Widen your uncertainty range/distribution

    -   Consider scenario analysis

## Productivity costs

-   Typically largest non-health cost in societal perspective

-   Unpaid labor (housekeeping, child-rearing) can be costed as "opportunity cost"

    -   Use median wage for all individuals regardless of employment

-   For death-related productivity loss, we want "net productivity loss" with consumption subtracted out

## Unrelated medical costs in life-years gained

-   Interventions that extend life result in healthcare costs unrelated to the condition

-   There are strong arguments that they should be included

    -   [Rappange et. al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200826100-00003)

    -   [van Baal et. al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-018-0976-0)

-   But most analysts don't, and methods to do so are not well-established

## Today

-   Decision analytic frameworks

-   Quantifying health

-   Quantifying costs

-   **Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)**

## Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio

Cost-effectiveness focuses on **incremental** costs/outcomes (not **total** costs/outcomes)

-   Incremental effect: $E[\Delta_e]=\bar{e}_1 - \bar{e}_0$

-   Incremental cost: $E[\Delta_c]=\bar{c}_1 - \bar{c}_0$

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio:

$$
ICER = \frac{\bar{c}_1 - \bar{c}_0}{\bar{e}_1 - \bar{e}_0} = \frac{E[\Delta_c]}{E[\Delta_e]}
$$

*What is the increase in net spending per unit of net health benefit?*

::: {.column width="50%"}
Depends what we're willing to pay (WTP threshold)

-   **Q1:** ICER \< WTP → alternative cost-effective

-   **Q3:** ICER \< WTP → SQ not cost-effective compared to alternative

    -   Alternative 'worse' but preferred

    -   Politically difficult!
:::
:::

## Avoid confusion when reporting ICERS

-   Instead of reporting negative ICERs, say it's '**dominated**' (Q4) or '**dominant**' (Q2)

-   If in Q3, reverse comparison when reporting ICER

    -   **Alternative in Q1**: Alternative costs \$32,000 per QALY gained compared to status quo

    -   **Alternative in Q3**: Status quo costs \$32,000 per QALY gained compared to alternative

## Evaluating \>2 alternatives

With \>2 alternatives, conduct incremental analysis:

1.  Order by increasing effectiveness

2.  Remove dominated alternatives

3.  Calculate ICERs between non-dominated alternatives

Each strategy's ICER is relative to **next-least-effective, non-dominated** intervention

## Strong dominance

-   Dominated if ≥1 alt. cheaper and more effective

-   **Check:** Order by increasing effectiveness. Any alt. with higher cost than next alt. is dominated

-   a 'convex hull' (no concavities)

-   Dominated interventions above frontier

1.  Order alternatives by increasing effectiveness

2.  Remove strongly dominated *(cost exceeds next non-dominated)*

    -   Repeat until all strongly dominated removed

3.  Calculate ICERS between non-dominated

4.  Remove weakly dominated *(ICER exceeds next non-dominated)*

-   Maximum cost per QALY considered cost-effective

-   Related to opportunity cost

-   CAD\$50,000/QALY cited in many CADTH reports

-   [Griffiths and Vadlamudi (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.09.821) found drugs with ICERs up to \$131,100 often approved

-   WTP higher in some contexts (orphan drugs, blood safety)
:::
:::

## Net monetary benefit

-   ICER not ideal in some contexts: negative ICERs are ambiguous; ratios are unstable with small denominators; incremental analysis requires loops

-   Net Monetary Benefit uses WTP to monetize health benefits:

$$
NMB_a = \bar{c}_a + \bar{e}_a\times WTP
$$

-   $NMB_a \geq NMB_b \Leftrightarrow ICER_{\text{\{a vs. b\}}} \leq WTP$, both imply that $a$ is preferred (cost-effective) compared to $b$

## Cost effective ≠ affordable

-   Costs often "front-loaded"

    -   Large upfront investment; gains take years to realize

-   Payer for intervention may not realize cost savings

-   **Example:** [Liu et. al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.7326/M14-0602) found:

    -   Treating HCV+ prisoners with Sofosbuvir costs \<US\$30,000 per QALY (yay!)

    -   \$32 billion upfront cost, paid by correctional system

    -   Cost offsets after release benefit other payers

## Recap

-   Decision analysis focuses on incremental impact of interventions

-   Decision analyses that include costs are economic evaluations

-   Cost-effectiveness determined with Incremental analysis, ICERs, and willingness-to-pay
