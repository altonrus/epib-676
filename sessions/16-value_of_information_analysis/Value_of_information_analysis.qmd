## Recap

-   **EVPI**: expected value of reducing [**all**]{.underline} uncertainty in [**all**]{.underline} parameters

    -   Most I should spend on research whatsoever

    -   Easy to compute from PSA inputs/outputs

-   **EVPPI**: expected value of reducing [**all**]{.underline} uncertainty in [**some**]{.underline} parameters

    -   Most I should spend on a study targeting specific variables

-   **EVSI**: expected value of a study with specific sample size

-   **ENBS**: EVSI minus cost of the study

## Logistics
