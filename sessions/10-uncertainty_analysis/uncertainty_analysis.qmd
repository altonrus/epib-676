## 1st and 2nd order uncertainty

-   **First order** **(stochastic) uncertainty:** variation between statistically identical patients

-   **Second order (parameter) uncertainty:** uncertainty in a population parameter

In a cohort model first order uncertainty is ignored; everyone in cohort is modeled as the "average" person

In microsimulation, both first and second order undertainty are modeled

## 1st and second order uncertainty in Bayesian terms

## Distributions for data-free parameters

## Notes

-   Model function maping inputs to outputs. Parametric uncertainty analysis is just changing inputs

-   How model is structured has implications for uncertainty analysis

    -   Using multipliers rather than absolute probabilities can let you enforce certain relationships

-   Dirichlet distribution
