## Notes

-   Model function maping inputs to outputs. Parametric uncertainty analysis is just changing inputs

-   How model is structured has implications for uncertainty analysis

    -   Using multipliers rather than absolute probabilities can let you enforce certain relationships

-   Dirichlet distribution

## Recap

## Next class: More cohort models
