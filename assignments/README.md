When assignments are ready to be completed, they will be available as a .zip file, like 'assign0.zip'.

**If a zip file is not yet available for the assignment, it is subject to change and not yet ready for students to complete it.**

There are two ways to complete assignments.

**Option 1: Download zip file from Github**

* Download and extract the zip file
* Complete the assignment by opening the .qmd file in Rstudio and following the instructions to add code or text responses
* Render your document to .html as you go to view your progress
* Once complete, upload the .html file on MyCourses for grading

**Option 2: Work from your own local copy of the EPIB 676 github repo:**
* 'Pull' the epid-676 repo from Github.
* **rename** the .qmd file for the assignment (e.g. add your initials) before making any edits to avoid future merge conflicts
* Complete and submit the assignment, same as in Option 1.
